Figure out how you want to structure your paragraph. 
Now that all of your thoughts, ideas, facts, and figures 
are laid out clearly in front of you, you can start to think
about how you would like to structure your paragraph. 
Consider each of the points you wish to address and try 
to arrange them in a logical order - this will make your 
paragraph more coherent and easier to read
